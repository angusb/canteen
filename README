Canteen is an in progress Python web framework.  It has a WSGI app that should be compatible with any WSGI server (although I haven't tested yet).

So far, users can add functions in the following format:

@app.add_route(/hello)
def say_hello(user):
	return 'Top of the morning, ', user

currently adding support for different request methods and session management.
